# The MCP server and its Streamable HTTP transport are built here, once at boot,
# following the "Rails (mount)" pattern from the top-level README.
# Routes are loaded after the application initializes, so the tool classes in app/tools
# are available at this point (they are not yet available in config/initializers,
# where Zeitwerk has not set up autoloading).
#
# The transport keeps session and SSE state in memory, so run a single server process
# (e.g., Puma with `workers 0`, which is the rackup default).
# See the top-level README for multi-instance and stateless deployment notes.
